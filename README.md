# PetersPVP
PVP Arena system, intended to be used for my personal Garry's Mod server (but can be used on anybody's). My intention is to use this
gamemode to build an arena system with a web-end that allows users to find their player stats and view tournament brackets and teams.

## Installing PetersPVP
Please use either git or the workshop(coming soon).
Manually downloading PetersPVP (not recommended).
